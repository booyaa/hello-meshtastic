# Covert Deck

A writer deck with covert LoRa capabilities.

## Rationale

None at all just an excuse to mash some component together and experiment by 
combining different styles of decks: cyber, writer, hack. The only core value
is that the device must be portable and battery operated.

## Features

- Distraction free writing device, terminal based
- No disruptive notifications from the radio (LoRa) when not used
- Optional BBS software to be installed on aother radio to facilitate
  - automatic publishing of micro publications
  - limited messaging with your "team" to discuss edits and gather feedback, 
  or just check in to confirm you haven't been eaten by bears
  - research and summarise topics you wish to write about
